# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on **square footage**, **number of bedrooms**, and **number of bathrooms**.  
It demonstrates the core steps of building a supervised machine learning model using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train a regression model that can accurately predict housing prices using simple property features.  
This is a common example used in data science to understand linear relationships between variables.

## 🧠 Features

- 📁 Generate or load a housing dataset  
- 🧹 Data preprocessing (handle missing values, feature selection)  
- ✂️ Train-test data split (80/20)  
- 📈 Model training using **Linear Regression**  
- 🧾 Model evaluation (R² score, Mean Squared Error)  
- 📊 Visualizations:
  - Actual vs. Predicted Prices
  - Feature Coefficients (importance of each feature)
